# Incorporating Security into the Agile Methodology

This repo contains the source for a brown bag presentation on how to incorporate Security into the Agile process, delivered to a group of colleagues at VMware on October 10th, 2022.

It was largely based on real-life experience while working as anchor and Security SME for the Pivotal Solutions team (now Tanzu Labs), from 2014 to 2016.

The slides are intended to be presented as baselines for discussion, in order to iterate to improve the process itself. It's not meant to be fully comprehensive, nor a definitive answer to a complex issue.

The presentation is written in [Marp](https://marp.app/), and can be rendered into HTML, PDF or any other format the Marp ecosystem supports
