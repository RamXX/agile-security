# Incorporating Security into the Agile Methodology

This repo contains the source for a brown bag presentation on how to incorporate Security into the Agile process, delivered to a group of colleagues at VMware on October 10th, 2022.

It was largely based on real-life experience while working as anchor and Security SME for the Pivotal Solutions team (now Tanzu Labs), from 2014 to 2016, and as a Networking Product Lead from 2018 to 2020.

The slides are intended to be presented as a baseline for discussion, in order to iterate and improve the process itself. They're not meant to be fully comprehensive, nor a definitive answer to a complex issue.

The presentation is written in [Marp](https://marp.app/), and can be rendered into HTML, PDF or any other format the Marp ecosystem supports

# Viewing the Slides
